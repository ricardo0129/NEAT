Notes

Genomes
-genomes are linear representation of network
-genomes include conenction genomes
-connection genes have {in/out nodes, weight, enable bit, innovation numebr}

Mutation
-add connection: a connection is added connecting two previously unconnected nodes
-add node: an existing connection is split and a new node is added. Old connection disabled new connection leading to the new node weight of 1. and the latter old weight

Historical markings
-each gene is tracked through a global innovation numebr

Mating
-matching genes are inhered randomly, disjoint and excess genes are inhereted from more fit parent
-equal fitness means randomly chosen genes
-Theres a preset change that inhereted gene is disabled if it is disabled in either parent 
-disabled genes may become enabled again in the future 

speciation
-delta = c1E/N + c2D/N + c3*W
E is number of excess
D is number of disjoin
W is the average weight difference of matching genes inlcuding disabeld 
N the number of genes in the larger genome. N if both are small ie <20. 
-Each species has a genome as its represetative
-The new generation gets placed in the first species that is close with the representative of that species
-If there isn't a any species then a new one is created with that genome as the representative 

fitness
-fi' = fi/sh(d(i,j))for all j
the denomination reduces to the number of organisms in the species(said by the paper but doesnt make sense)
-The function d(i,j) is 0 or 1 depending if the threshold dt is reached. But we know that when choosing where an organism is put, 
we just pick the first species. This means there can be multiple organims where the threshold is achieved but not part of that species.
-I shall implement it as said but might go back and fix this 
-In rare conditions where the fitness of the entire population doesnt increase after 20 gens. Then only the top two species are allowed to reproduce 

params
-c1: 1.0
-c2: 1.0
-c3: 0.4
dt = 3.0
champion of species with >5 moved on unchanged
-80% chance of a genome wegiht mutated
-90% uniforfmly perturbed 10% being assinged new random value 
-75% chance the inheried gene was disabled if either parent had it disabeld
-25% of offsprint were result of mutation without crossover
-interspecies mating was 0.001
-in smaller networks adding new node 0.03, new link mutation 0.05
-in larger adding new link was 0.3	
-activation function sgimoidal (1/(1+exp(x*-4.9)))
